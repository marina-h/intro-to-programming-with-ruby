# Chapter 10: Exercises
# Exercise 11

# Look at several Rails/Ruby online API sources and say which one you like best and why.


# I like the http://ruby-doc.org/ site since it provides examples showing how to 
# use many of the methods. For Rails, http://api.rubyonrails.org/ has a similar
# layout with method usage examples.
