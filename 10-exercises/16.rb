# Exercise 16

# Take the following array:

a = ['white snow', 'winter wonderland', 'melting ice',
     'slippery sidewalk', 'salted roads', 'white trees']
# and turn it into a new array that consists of strings containing one word. 
# (ex. ["white snow", etc...] â†’ ["white", "snow", etc...]. Look into using 
# Array's map and flatten methods, as well as String's split method.

a.map! { |words| words.split }
a.flatten!
p a
